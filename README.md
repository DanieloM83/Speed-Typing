# Speed Typing

**An application to test your typing speed in your terminal.** Clear functionality, nothing extra, just you and the terminal.

## Usage

To try this program, follow the steps below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DanieloM83/Speed-Typing.git

cd Speed-Typing

pip install -r requirements.txt

python src/main.py  # use --help flag for more info
```

You can also specify a `source file` for your typing test. Place **.txt** file in the `samples/` folder, and run program with **-s flag.** Note that each word must be separated by a newline symbol (`\n`).

> [!WARNING]
> Cyrillic is not supported :(
